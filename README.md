cryptography technique:- Basic Encryption Code

Lines 2 and 3: Taking input that contains message and key
Line 5: Inputs is passed into a function named 'encryption' as function parameters
Line 6: Initialise a variable cipher
Line 7: Looping based on the length of the input variable-msg
Line 8: Storing every character that is stored in the variable msg to the variable c. On every iteration, each character gets                              
        stored in the variable c
Line 9: Check whether the character stored in valriable is uppercase or not. If uppercase then the code uses the logic to transform 
        the actual plain text into an ecrypted form
Line 10: If not uppercase then all the other characters or symbols or numbers will be handled by the logic written in else block
Line 17,18 and 19: Printing the final output

Note: ord() method in python3 converts character to its ascii value
      chr() method in python3 converts ascii value to its corresponding character
